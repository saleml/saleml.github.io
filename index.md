Overall, I am more interested in understanding (and therefore defining) intelligence, be it animal or artificial.

Before this, I worked at <a href="https://www.tii.ae/" target="_blank">TII</a> as a Senior Researcher in 2024, obtained my PhD in 2023 from <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank">Mila</a> and <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/en" target="_blank">UdeM</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio</a>, interned in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&themeRefresh=1">Google Brain</a> in Paris in 2020 to work on hierarchical reinforcement learning. Prior to my PhD, I studied applied mathematics in <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/" target="_blank">Ecole Polytechnique</a> and statistical learning in <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/" target="_blank">Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay</a>. I did research in game theory and operations research in <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8131" target="_blank">IBM Research Singapore</a>, and worked as a data scientist in <a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> in Amsterdam.
