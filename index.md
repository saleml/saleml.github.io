    I am an Assistant Professor at the Machine Learning department of the <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/" target="_blank">Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)</a>. My research focuses on areas like LLM reasoning, GFlowNets, uncertainty estimation, reinforcement learning sample complexity, and more broadly, on designing better "AI for science" tools.

        I build more capable and reliable AI. My research focuses on teaching machines to reason, plan, and generate diverse solutions under uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work is centered on three key areas:
      </p>
      <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <strong>Developing Novel Methods:</strong> I am a core contributor to <strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)</strong>, a modern framework for structured probabilistic sampling. I also design new techniques for crucial problems like <strong>uncertainty estimation (DEUP)</strong> and <strong>efficient curriculum learning</strong>.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <strong>Advancing Large Language Models:</strong> I apply these methods to improve the reasoning and alignment of LLMs, with projects focused on enhancing multi-step logic and fine-tuning models with human preferences.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
          <strong>Building Tools for the Community:</strong> I believe in advancing science through shared tools. I created the <strong><code><a href="https://github.com/GFNOrg/torchgfn" target="_blank">torchgfn</a></code></strong> library for GFlowNets and have co-led the development of benchmarks like <strong><a href="https://minigrid.farama.org/" target="_blank">BabyAI</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/finchain" target="_blank">FinChain</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench" target="_blank">LLM-BabyBench</a></strong>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I aim to create AI systems that are robust, creative, and trustworthy enough for real-world deployment.

    Ultimately, I am driven by a deep interest in understanding and defining intelligence, whether it's in animals or artificial systems. While I'm excited about the potential of AI, I'm also mindful of its limitations and potential pitfalls – I'm definitely not a technosolutionist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before my current role, I worked at <a href="https://www.tii.ae/" target="_blank">TII</a> as a Senior Researcher in 2024. I obtained my PhD in 2023 from <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank">Mila</a> and <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/en" target="_blank">UdeM</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio</a>. During my PhD, I also interned at Google Brain in Paris in 2020, focusing on hierarchical reinforcement learning. My academic background includes studies in applied mathematics at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/" target="_blank">Ecole Polytechnique</a> and statistical learning at <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/" target="_blank">Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay</a>. I've also explored research in game theory and operations research at <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8131" target="_blank">IBM Research Singapore</a> and gained industry experience as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> in Amsterdam.
