Hello,

I am Salem Lahlou, a last year PhD candidate at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/){:target="_blank"} and [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en){:target="_blank"}, under the supervision of [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are broad. During my PhD, I worked on reinforcement learning, uncertainty estimation, curriculum learning, and probabilistic modeling. I like to use math to get guarantees about the performances of machine learning algorithms, and to develop insights about their behavior and how to improve them.

Prior to my PhD, I studied applied mathematics in [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/){:target="_blank"} and statistical learning in [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/){:target="_blank"}. I did research in game theory and operations research in [IBM Research Singapore](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8131){:target="_blank"}, and worked as a data scientist in Booking.com in Amsterdam.
