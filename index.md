I am an Assistant Professor at the Machine Learning department of the [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/){:target="_blank"}, focusing on uncertainty estimation, generative models, reinforcement learning sample complexity, and more generally in designing better "AI for science" tools.

<span style="color:green">**I am actively recruiting **highly motivated** students!**</span> If you're interested in joining my group as a PhD student, Master's student, or research associate, do not hesitate to [send me an e-mail](mailto:salem.lahlou@mbzuai.ac.ae), with your CV, your interests, and a few words about your previous research experience. 

<span style="color:green">**Research topics include but are not limited to:**</span>
- AI for science tools
- Sample efficient reinforcement learning
- Curriculum learning
- Uncertainty estimation
- Active Learning
- Bayesian Optimization
- Generative flow networks - including the [torchgfn](https://github.com/GFNOrg/torchgfn){:target="_blank"} GFlowNet library
- Probabilistic modeling
- Generative models
- Reasoning
- Large Language Model Reasoning

Overall, I am more interested in understanding (and therefore defining) intelligence, be it animal or artificial.

Before this, I worked at [TII](https://www.tii.ae/){:target="_blank"} as a Senior Researcher in 2024, obtained my PhD in 2023 from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/){:target="_blank"} and [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en){:target="_blank"}, under the supervision of [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/){:target="_blank"}, interned in [Google Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&themeRefresh=1) in Paris in 2020 to work on hierarchical reinforcement learning. Prior to my PhD, I studied applied mathematics in [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/){:target="_blank"} and statistical learning in [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/){:target="_blank"}. I did research in game theory and operations research in [IBM Research Singapore](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8131){:target="_blank"}, and worked as a data scientist in [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) in Amsterdam.



I have provided consulting services to dozens startups. [Contact me](mailto:salem.lahlou@mbzuai.ac.ae) if interested!
