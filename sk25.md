#### Using the Colab Notebooks

There are two main ways to use the provided Colab notebooks:

1.  **Run Directly in Google Colab (Recommended):**
    *   Click the link for the notebook (e.g., "[**Notebook/Colab 1**]"). This will open the **read-only** notebook in Google Colab.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Before running any code or making changes, save your own editable copy to your Google Drive by going to `File` -> `Save a copy in Drive`. You'll need a Google account.
    *   Work with your saved copy. You can now run code cells and experiment freely.

2.  **Download and Run Locally:**
    *   Click the Colab link to open the notebook.
    *   Go to `File` -> `Download` -> `Download .ipynb` to save the notebook file to your computer.
    *   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook/Lab installed (`pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab`).
    *   You may also need to install required libraries mentioned in the notebook (usually via `pip install ...`).
    *   Open your terminal, navigate to where you downloaded the file, and run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`. Open the `.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface.
